# Encrypt-and-Decrypt-a-File
Code on file encryption and decryption.
 code to encrypt the data (content) of a textual file. And another code to decrypt the same data of a textual file.

What an Encryption and Decryption Means ?
Encryption of a data means converting the data from original form into a coded form. The coded form of original data can not be read by an unauthorized person.

Decryption of a data means, converting data from coded form to its original form.

Encrypted data can only be accessed by an authorized person.

Note - Authorized person knows the decryption key. Decryption key is a password or formula that is used to convert cyphertext to plaintext

Note - Encrypted data is known as cyphertext, whereas decrypted data (original data) is known as plaintext.

Therefore in simple language, converting data from plaintext to cyphertext is known as data encryption. Whereas converting data from cyphertext to plaintext is known as data decryption.

Things to Do before Program
Because the program given below encrypts the data of a text file and then further decrypt the same data with another program. We must have to create a textual file say, codescracker.txt in current directory.

The current directory means, the directory where the C++ souce code is saved. Therefore because I'm going to save the program of encrypt and decrypt a file in cpp programs folder. Then in the same folder, creates a file named codescracker.txt with following content inside it:


 
username = codescrackerUser
password = codescrackerPassword
